# Frontend Tech Stack & Implementation

## **Project Description**
We are building a website for a local tattoo artist. The goal is to create a beautiful, artistically inspired UI that reflects the artist's work while serving as a comprehensive small business portal. The site will integrate with Square for payments and bookings, allowing customers to submit detailed tattoo requests, including image uploads. The backend will include a full business management system for the artist, including booking management, payment processing, accounting logs, and appointment management.

## **Tech Stack**

- **Next.js (React + TypeScript)** - For fast, SEO-friendly, and scalable front-end development.
- **Tailwind CSS** (with **DaisyUI**) - To create a unique, visually rich UI that matches the tattoo artist's style.
- **React Dropzone & Cloudinary** - For image uploads in the submission form, allowing users to drag and drop reference images and we will use Cloudinary for efficient, high-quality image delivery with transformations.
- **Next/Image** - For optimized image handling, especially for portfolio pages.
- **Supabase** - For managing customer and tattoo booking data, along with image metadata if needed.

## **Implementation Details**

### 1. Core Structure & Routing (Next.js)
    - **Pages:** Define the main pages of the website (e.g., Home, Portfolio, Artist Bio, Booking/Consultation Request, Contact, FAQ).
    - **Layouts:** Create reusable layout components (e.g., Header, Footer, Navigation) for consistent structure across pages.
    - **Routing:** Utilize Next.js file-system routing for intuitive page navigation.

### 2. Styling & UI (Tailwind CSS & DaisyUI)
    - **Theme Customization:** Configure Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI to reflect the artist's unique style and branding. This includes color palettes, typography, and component styling.
    - **Custom Components:** Develop reusable UI components (e.g., buttons, cards, modals) beyond DaisyUI's offerings if needed, ensuring they align with the artistic vision.
    - **Responsive Design:** Ensure the UI is fully responsive and provides an optimal experience across all devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).

### 3. Image Handling
    - **Image Uploads (React Dropzone & Cloudinary):**
        - Integrate React Dropzone into the tattoo request form for easy drag-and-drop image uploads by users.
        - Implement client-side validation for image types and sizes.
        - Securely upload images to Cloudinary, handling API interactions and storing image URLs/metadata.
    - **Optimized Image Display (Next/Image & Cloudinary):**
        - Use `next/image` for optimized loading, resizing, and serving of images, especially in the portfolio and gallery sections.
        - Leverage Cloudinary's transformation capabilities (e.g., cropping, quality adjustments, format conversion) to serve images efficiently.

### 4. Booking & Submission Forms
    - **Tattoo Request Form:**
        - Design a comprehensive form allowing users to submit detailed tattoo requests: description, preferred style, body placement, size, reference images (via React Dropzone), and any other relevant information.
        - Implement form validation and user feedback mechanisms.
    - **Square Integration (Frontend Aspects):**
        - Facilitate the booking process by integrating with Square. This might involve:
            - Displaying available booking slots (if fetched from Square or Supabase).
            - Redirecting users to Square's platform for payment and final booking confirmation.
            - Handling callback/redirects from Square to confirm booking status on the website.

### 5. Data Management & Backend Interaction (Supabase)
    - **Portfolio Management:** Fetch and display tattoo portfolio images and details from Supabase.
    - **Booking Data:** Send tattoo request form data to Supabase for storage and backend processing by the artist.
    - **Customer Data:** (If applicable) Manage customer information related to bookings or accounts via Supabase.
    - **API Routes (Next.js):** Create API routes within Next.js to handle communication between the frontend and Supabase (e.g., submitting form data, fetching data).

### 6. UI/UX & Artistic Vision
    - **Artistic Inspiration:** Ensure all UI elements, animations, and interactions are thoughtfully designed to reflect the tattoo artist's work and aesthetic.
    - **User Experience:** Prioritize a smooth, intuitive, and engaging user journey from browsing the portfolio to submitting a tattoo request.
    - **Accessibility (a11y):** Implement web accessibility best practices to ensure the site is usable by people with disabilities.

### 7. State Management
    - Evaluate the need for a dedicated state management library (e.g., Zustand, Jotai, or React Context API) based on the complexity of shared state across components. Start with React Context for simpler cases.

### 8. SEO & Performance
    - Leverage Next.js features (SSR/SSG) for optimal SEO performance.
    - Implement best practices for web performance: code splitting, lazy loading, image optimization, and minimizing bundle sizes.
